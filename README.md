# anomaly_detection
This repository will be used in future to work on unsupervised anomaly detection tasks in Python.

Following datasets are selected for the evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms:
- Numenta Anomaly Benchmark Dataset (ressource: https://github.com/numenta/NAB)
- Yahoo S5 - A Labeled Anomaly Detection Dataset (ressource: tinyurl.com/yahoo-s5-ad-dataset)
- Artificial Signal Generator Dataset (created by own experiments on industrial hardware)
